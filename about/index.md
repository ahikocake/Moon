I started gaming when I was around 5 years old playing RPGs on the SNES. When I was 10, I played Phantasy Star Online (on dial-up!) and fell in love with MMORPGs ever since.

On the other side of the screen, my real name is Dana. I recently completed my MS Computer Science degree and am from the San Francisco Bay Area! I hope to encourage and inspire women in tech. Causes I support are #WomenInComputing and #ILookLikeAnEngineer.
